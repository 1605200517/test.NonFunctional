#IDAS: non functional test guidelines

IoT Broker is the FIWARE reference implementation by the IoT Broker Generic Enabler by NEC and available at its GitHub repository. The description of the non functional tests carried out on this implementation is also published via the GitHub repository at Fiware/test.NonFunctional

##Testing environment

For the testing environment, is needed: 

* A machine for the deployment of the GEri to be tested, IDAS Agent.
* A machine for with an Orion Context Broker instance (can be the same if there are enough resources). Docker version can be used.
* A machine for JMeter, the tool used to inject load and for simulating the client and collecting the results generated by IDAS.
For example, in the latest test related to version 5.3 of the GEri, all the configured VMs in a dedicated FIWARE Lab were equipped with 2 CPU 2,3 GHz with 4GB RAM and 40 GB HD.
